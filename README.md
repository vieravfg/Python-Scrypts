## Background
In this homework assignment, I'll be completing **two** Python Challenges, PyBank and PyPoll.

Both of these challenges encompass a real-world situations. 

### Instructions

#### PyBank

* Create a Python script for analyzing the financial records of the company. The financial dataset is called [budget_data.csv](PyPoll/Analysis/pypoll_analysis.txt). The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`. 

* The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

* In addition, the final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

### PyPoll

* Help a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.

* The poll dataset is called [election_data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv). The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. The task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

* In addition, the final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
